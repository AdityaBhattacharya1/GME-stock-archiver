# What is a Candlestick Chart?
A candlestick chart is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency. Each "candlestick" typically shows one day, thus a one-month chart may show the 20 trading days as 20 candlesticks. <br />

# How To Read The Chart

It is similar to a bar chart in that each candlestick represents all four important pieces of information for that day: open and close in the thick body; high and low in the “candle wick”. Being densely packed with information, it tends to represent trading patterns over short periods of time, often a few days or a few trading sessions. <br />

A short upper wick on an up day dictates that the close was near the high. The relationship between the days open, high, low, and close determines the look of the daily candlestick. 

-   Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns.

-   Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.

-   Many algorithms are based on the same price information shown in candlestick charts.

-   Trading is often dictated by emotion, which can be read in candlestick charts.
